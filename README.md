**Abstract:** *The remarkable efficacy of text-to-image diffusion models has motivated extensive exploration of their potential application in video domains.
Zero-shot methods seek to extend image diffusion models to videos without necessitating model training.
Recent methods mainly focus on incorporating inter-frame correspondence into attention mechanisms. However, the soft constraint imposed on determining where to attend to valid features can sometimes be insufficient, resulting in temporal inconsistency.
In this paper, we introduce FRESCO, intra-frame correspondence alongside inter-frame correspondence to establish a more robust spatial-temporal constraint. This enhancement ensures a more consistent transformation of semantically similar content across frames. Beyond mere attention guidance, our approach involves an explicit update of features to achieve high spatial-temporal consistency with the input video, significantly improving the visual coherence of the resulting translated videos.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in producing high-quality, coherent videos, marking a notable improvement over existing zero-shot methods.*

**Features**:<br>
- **Temporal consistency**: use intra-and inter-frame constraint with better consistency and coverage than optical flow alone.
    - Compared with our previous work [Rerender-A-Video](https://github.com/williamyang1991/Rerender_A_Video), FRESCO is more robust to large and quick motion.
- **Zero-shot**: no training or fine-tuning required.
- **Flexibility**: compatible with off-the-shelf models (e.g., [ControlNet](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet), [LoRA](https://civitai.com/)) for customized translation.

# Installation and Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that your system has the necessary tools installed. You can install them using the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install git-lfs ffmpeg cbm
```

## Clone the Repository

Next, clone the repository from Hugging Face:

```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/svjack/FRESCO && cd FRESCO
```

## Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run 
```bash
python app.py
```

## Additional Note for Anime Models

If you are working with anime models, you might want to try the following model, which supports various LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) merges:

```bash
stablediffusionapi/flat-2d-animerge
```

This model is designed to handle different LoRA configurations, making it versatile for various anime-style image generation tasks.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository. 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/williamyang1991/FRESCO.git
cd FRESCO
```

2. You can simply set up the environment with pip based on [requirements.txt](https://github.com/williamyang1991/FRESCO/blob/main/requirements.txt)
    - Create a conda environment and install torch >= 2.0.0. Here is an example script to install torch 2.0.0 + CUDA 11.8 :
    ```
    conda create --name diffusers python==3.8.5
    conda activate diffusers
    pip install torch==2.0.0 torchvision==0.15.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
    ```
    - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in an environment where torch is installed.
    - We have tested on torch 2.0.0/2.1.0 and diffusers 0.19.3
    - If you use new versions of diffusers, you need to modify [my_forward()](https://github.com/williamyang1991/FRESCO/blob/fb991262615665de88f7a8f2cc903d9539e1b234/src/diffusion_hacked.py#L496)

3. Run the installation script. The required models will be downloaded in `./model`, `./src/ControlNet/annotator` and `./src/ebsynth/deps/ebsynth/bin`.
    - Requires access to huggingface.co

```shell
python install.py
```

4. You can run the demo with `run_fresco.py`

```shell
python run_fresco.py ./config/config_music.yaml
```

5. For issues with Ebsynth, please refer to [issues](https://github.com/williamyang1991/Rerender_A_Video#issues)


## (1) Inference

### WebUI (recommended)

```
python webUI.py
```
The Gradio app also allows you to flexibly change the inference options. Just try it for more details. 

Upload your video, input the prompt, select the model and seed, and hit:
- **Run Key Frames**: detect keyframes, translate all keyframes.
- **Run Propagation**: propagate the keyframes to other frames for full video translation
- **Run All**: **Run Key Frames** and **Run Propagation**

Select the model:
- **Base model**: base Stable Diffusion model (SD 1.5)
    - Stable Diffusion 1.5: official model
    - [rev-Animated](https://huggingface.co/stablediffusionapi/rev-animated): a semi-realistic (2.5D) model

### Command Line

We provide a flexible script `run_fresco.py` to run our method.

Set the options via a config file. For example,
```shell
python run_fresco.py ./config/config_music.yaml
```
We provide some examples of the config in `config` directory.
Most options in the config is the same as those in WebUI.
Please check the explanations in the WebUI section.

We provide a separate Ebsynth python script `video_blend.py` with the temporal blending algorithm introduced in
[Stylizing Video by Example](https://dcgi.fel.cvut.cz/home/sykorad/ebsynth.html) for interpolating style between key frames.
It can work on your own stylized key frames independently of our FRESCO algorithm.

```python
video_blend.py [-h] [--output OUTPUT] [--fps FPS] [--key_ind KEY_IND [KEY_IND ...]] [--key KEY] [--n_proc N_PROC] [-ps] [-ne] [-tmp] name

positional arguments:
  name                  Path to input video

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --output OUTPUT       Path to output video
  --fps FPS             The FPS of output video
  --key_ind KEY_IND [KEY_IND ...]
                        key frame index
  --key KEY             The subfolder name of stylized key frames
  --n_proc N_PROC       The max process count
  -ps                   Use poisson gradient blending
  -ne                   Do not run ebsynth (use previous ebsynth output)
  -tmp                  Keep temporary output
```
An example
```
python video_blend.py ./output/dog/ --key keys --key_ind 0 11 23 33 49 60 72 82 93 106 120 137 151 170 182 193 213 228 238 252 262 288 299  --output ./output/dog/blend.mp4 --fps 24 --n_proc 4 -ps
```

For the details, please refer to our previous work [Rerender-A-Video](https://github.com/williamyang1991/Rerender_A_Video/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#our-ebsynth-implementation) (The mainly difference is the way of specifying key frame index)
